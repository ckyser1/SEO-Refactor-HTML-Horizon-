# SEO-Refactor-HTML-Horizon-
OSU Bootcamp first assignment.  Horizon Refactor

The purpose of this project was to edit an existing website with updated HTML identifiers and user friendly features to better allow for optimized search engine capability.  The code was further modified by consolidating certain lines of code, as well as adding comments on both the html, and css sections.

The modified code removes older div functions with newer ones.  Such as section, nav, aside, and main.

A quick overview of the website shows a block set up with a header section that links further down the document.  A main section with basic information.  An aside section that shows some of the companies capabilities, as well as a footer with some company info.
